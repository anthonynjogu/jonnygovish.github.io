    <h2>Interest in Programming</h2>
      <p>For as long as I can remember I have always been facinated by this thing called computer. As i grow up, I held to this notion that one day i'll learn how to code, but my parents ahd a different career path for me. So that was the path i took unitl it dawned on me that its about time i do what i love which is coding. To cut the long story short thats how i found myself here.</P>
